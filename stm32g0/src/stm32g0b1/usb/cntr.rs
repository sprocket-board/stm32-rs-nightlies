This bit is cleared by hardware simultaneous with the WAKEUP flag set. Host mode Software can set this bit when Host application has nothing scheduled for the next frames and wants to enter long term power saving. When set, it stops immediately SOF generation and any other host activity, gates the USB clock and sets the transceiver in low power mode. If any USB transaction is on-going at the time SUSPEN is set, suspend is entered at the end of the current transaction.
