The USB peripheral handles this event in the following way: During reception an ACK handshake packet is not sent, during transmission a bit-stuff error is forced on the transmitted stream; in both cases the host will retry the transaction. The PMAOVR interrupt should never occur during normal operations. Since the failed transaction is retried by the host, the application software has the chance to speed-up device operations during this interrupt handling, to be ready for the next transaction retry; however this does not happen during Isochronous transfers (no isochronous transaction is anyway retried) leading to a loss of data in this case. This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."]
